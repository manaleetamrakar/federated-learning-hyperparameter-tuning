# Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning in Federated Learning

This project explores the use of meta-learning techniques to optimize hyperparameters
in federated learning systems. The implementation uses TensorFlow and Streamlit
to demonstrate adaptive tuning under decentralized training settings.

## Notes
- The application is intended to be run locally due to ML dependencies.
- GitHub Pages is used separately for hosting the project presentation.
